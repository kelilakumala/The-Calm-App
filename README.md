# The-Calm-App
UI/UX design of a mental health application

The design of this application aims to provide guidance for people who require assistance for mental health. Based on the color, features, fonts, and design, the Calm app envokes a sense of tranquility and is user-friendly even for beginners.

The prototype of the app's interface consists of 6 sections:
1. Splash screen, login page, sign up page
2. Home page
3. Profile page
4. Psychiatrist/Psychologist page
5. Booking page
6. Payment/Chat column page

Each page is created to ensure that the user can easily book appointments and pay for each session while keeping track of their bookings. Users can also read articles about mental health to enrich their knowledge.
